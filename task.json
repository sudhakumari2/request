In 2004 a group of young and like-minded people joined hands and formed SPID with the goal to serve the needy. Since then, SPID has been working in the under-developed rural and urban areas. We aim at strengthening local governance that give the marginalized and poor communities irrespective of their caste, creed and religion, a voice and influence national policy.      We work with our 200 professionals are guided by an experienced governing body. SPID is located in the capital city of Delhi and runs operations in five districts of Uttar Pradesh too.
